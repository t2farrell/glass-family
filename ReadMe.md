# Glass Family

A 'glass family' was a concept product that used stained glass to create a representation of a family, similar to
the 'stick people' that you see on the back windows of many vehicles.  Various elements of the 'family' could be customized to create each custom product, including:

* Family Surname
* Number of family members
* Name of each family member
* Member type (Adult/Child)
* Member Sex (Male/Female)
* Shirt Color/Pants Color (Male)
* Dress Color (Female)

This prototype was built as a proof of concept.  The general idea was to create a dynamic client side web page that could:

* collect the configuration of a 'glass family' (configurable elements shown above)
* calculate a price for the configured product
* populate an html form that could be posted to the Paypal online payment service, to allow purchase/payment processing

This prototype was built using knockout.js.

The prototype contains some basic filler pages such as *About* and *Main*, but the primary work exists with the *configure.html* page.  Before any styling could be applied to the page, the project was dropped by the client.
